#summary GValidator roadmap and current status.

= Roadmap =

Currently, GValidator is a stand-alone library with no dependencies on any other library. I would like to keep it this way as much as possible, but there is a possibility of making a Mootools port which would be much more lightweight for Mootools adopters.

== Feature Wish list ==

* Set required/not-required using class 'required'
* Ability to add multiple class names to a field
* Ability to specify formatting options (Currency, decimals spring to mind) and have the data aligned to the specification i.e. $__,__.__ or something similar
* Ability to tailor how messages are displayed on a given field, using different elements etc.
